Had some good progress on State. I'm currently struggling with
implementing the bind function `=<<`, but found this wonderful [article
on
fpcomplete](https://www.fpcomplete.com/school/starting-with-haskell/basics-of-haskell/12-State-Monad)
I'm currently studying.

**Update:** It verks. The best take away of the article for me was this:

> When you execute a lambda, you simply replace it with its body and
> replace the formal parameter with the actual argument.

Stuck at implementing `fmap` for
[State.hs](https://github.com/NICTA/course/blob/master/src/Course/State.hs#L42).
My mental model is centred around the fact to apply the given function
`(a -> b)`
on a concrete value, but any attempt to isolate that value `a` fails.
Reading [this
article](http://brandon.si/code/the-state-monad-a-tutorial-for-the-confused/)
makes me wonder if function composition is making more sense here ...

**Update:** Got a bit further with a bit of help from #bfpg. I've
removed the State _wrapper_ and tried to implement:

    f :: (a -> b) -> (s -> (a, s)) -> (s -> (b, s))

My **first mistake** was to someone call the function in the second
parameter in order to apply the first parameter (function) to the value
in order to get `b`. As the [state monad article](http://brandon.si/code/the-state-monad-a-tutorial-for-the-confused/) already stated, we function composition is the key here. Think of the above type annotation as:

    f :: (s -> b) -> (s -> a) -> (a -> b)
    -- (.) :: (b -> c) -> (a -> b) -> a -> c

But that's not all, just using function composition like:

    f fx gx = fx . gx

leaves us with a compiler error: `Couldn't match type 'b' with '(b, s)'`.
Using a type hole in front of the `fx` tells us we need a function:

    foo :: (a -> b) -> (a, s) -> (b, s)

which makes the implementation way more straight forward. Apparently
thats exactly what
[first](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.8.1.0/docs/Control-Arrow.html#v:first) from `Control.Arrow` provides.

**Update:** I meant [first from Data.Bifunctor](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.8.1.0/docs/Data-Bifunctor.html#v:first) not `Control.Arrow`. Thanks to Fraser Tweedale, I got the "unwrapped" function right, but struggled putting it all back together with in:

    instance Functor (State s) where
      (<$>) ::
          (a -> b)
          -> State s a
          -> State s b

Turned out that I had **just a "spelling mistake" referring to the wrong
bound variable** in my function.

Progressed and now stuck at
[Bind.hs](https://github.com/NICTA/course/blob/ee8d1a294137c157c13740ac99a23a5dd5870b4a/src/Course/Bind.hs#L116).
Using type holes I got a solution:

    (=<<) f g = flip f <*> g

Unfortunately it ends up in an infinite recursion :(

**Update**: Found it. Got a hint from Tony Morris on #bfpg. Essentially
what it came down to is to take the `t` out of the second function and
proceed from there. How do I take out a parameter from a given function.
I had to go back to basics.
[This](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2801786/pattern-matching-for-lambda-expressions)
stack overflow question helped me to understand, especially this part:

    (Remember that f a b = ... is basically a shortcut for f a = \b ->
    ... which is a shortcut for f = \a -> \b -> ....)

My mental model always thought of functions as something like a callable, e.g.

    def foobar(callable):
        callable(a, b, c)

but there is a reason why people emphasize that functions always take
_one_ parameter.
