I've ran into a few problems with <a href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a> I'd like to document myself and how to solve them.
<h3>Overwriting an entrypoint</h3>
If you've configured a script as an entrypoint which fails, you can run the docker image with a shell in order to fiddle with the script (instead of continously rebuilding the image):
<pre>#--entrypoint (provides a new entry point which is the nominated shell)
docker run -i --entrypoint='/bin/bash'Â  -t f5d4a4d6a8eb</pre>
Possible errors you face otherwise are these:
<pre>/bin/bash: /bin/bash: cannot execute binary file</pre>
<h3>Weird errors when building the image</h3>
I've ran into this a few times. Errors like:
<pre id="comment_text_0" class="bz_comment_text                  bz_wrap_comment_text">Error in PREIN scriptlet in rpm package libvirt-daemon-0.9.11.4-3.fc17.x86_64
or
useradd: failure while writing changes to /etc/passwd
</pre>
If you've set <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SELinux">SELinux </a>to enforcing, you may want to temporarily disable SELinux for just building the image. <strong>Don't disable SELinux permanently.</strong>
<h3>Old (base) image</h3>
Check if your base image has changed (e.g. docker images) and pull it again (docker pull &lt;image&gt;)
