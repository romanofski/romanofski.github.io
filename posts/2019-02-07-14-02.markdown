In case you're using the nix package manager your <code>nix build</code> fails with:

<code>
these derivations will be built:

then the solution to it is actually easier then you think. It happens when you run

<code>
cabal new-repl
</code>

inside a nix shell, because cabal creates a hidden environment file. So look for a

<code>
.ghc.environment.--
# for example on Linux with GHC 8.6.3
.ghc.environment.x86_64-linux-8.6.3
</code>

Delete it and you should be good to go.
