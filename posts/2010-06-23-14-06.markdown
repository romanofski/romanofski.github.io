I really had a strange error when I was recently browsing to my web site. The nginx web server returned a 400, which only happened to me with my main browser: Mozilla Firefox.

After investigating, I figured, that it was a cookie which was sent by my browser and apparently set by <a href="http://www.infrae.com/products/kupu_editor" target="_self">Kupu</a> during editing. If you find this weird behaviour for your site as well, check the cookies. The cookie name which led to my problem was: initial_state. <strong>Delete it</strong> and you should be able to browse to wherever you run into this error first.
