title: "z3c.autoinclude does not automatically include a plone package"

Something I stumbled over just recently and is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pebkac#Acronyms_and_other_names_for_a_user_error">PEBKAC</a> again. What happens if you create a <a href="http://collective-docs.readthedocs.org/en/latest/buildout/creatingpackage.html">plone package</a> and you always need to explicitly specify the zcml slot for that package? Check the namespace declaration in the setup.py. That means, what I had configured:
<pre> namespace_packages=['mooball'],
 entry_points="""
 # -*- Entry points: -*-
 [z3c.autoinclude.plugin]
 target = plone
 """,</pre>
But the packages layout was "mooball.portlets.latestcontent". After digging, I found out that simply the <strong>namespace_package is incorrectly declared</strong>. Changing it to:
<pre> namespace_packages=['mooball', 'mooball.portlets'],
 entry_points="""
 # -*- Entry points: -*-
 [z3c.autoinclude.plugin]
 target = plone
 """,</pre>
... got it correctly included via z3c.autoinclude.
