One of the clients staging instances showed quite a few tracebacks of that type:

I'm getting to the point, since it had something to do with the deployment. Some packages were deployed as develop eggs on the instance. Only a few files were created with the wrong filesystem permissions, so neither Zope nor ZEO were able to access them. After changing the permissions the errors were gone. <strong>So be sure to check all filesystem permissions and if the processes have access to them. </strong>If that doesn't solve it, be sure to also <a href="http://developer.plone.org/troubleshooting/exceptions.html#valueerror-non-zero-version-length-versions-aren-t-supported">check if not your database is corrupt.</a>
