you are expected to restore xen shit, debug issues with database, set up servers, set up 
                    dns, customer support, write client documentation, edit images, manage time sheets, code 
                    websites, deploy websites, support legacy applications

 and its too much to ask an admin to restore a website
or even stop and start a zope instance
you are expected all of that and tom can't turn a viewlet off

suggesting a fulltext search for Kitovu after 1 1/2 of development vs. font-size problems which are labeled as obvious
