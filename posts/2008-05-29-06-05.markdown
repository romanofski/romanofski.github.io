Point 5: "Don't swim for at least a half-hour after eating." and further:
<blockquote>While your mother led you to believe that digestion diverts blood flow and oxygen from the limbs to the stomach -- increasing the likelihood of cramping up and potentially drowning -- today's accredited experts agree that the body holds more than enough oxygen to service both the stomach and the skeletal muscles.
</blockquote>What they're not telling is: After eating out in a snack bar, you don't want to do your laps in the swimming-pool. If you do, it can end up in indigestion, cramps or throwing up.

I propose that the authors of this article eat a steak before doing 100m in the swimming pool as fast as they can. I guess they'll literally think this through ;)
