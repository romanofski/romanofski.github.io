I watched <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trawlermen_(TV_series)" target="_self">Trawlermen</a> on <a href="http://www.sbs.com.au/" target="_self">SBS</a> yesterday. The documentary is about the work of a number of trawler crews based in Peterhead/Ireland. I have two quotes from the documentary which I found really interesting. It can be applied probably to any other business including writing software.

The skipper said: "Without my crew I'm nothing, because I can't catch the fish all by myself." The crew in turn said: "We have to trust the decisions made by the skipper. He leads us to the best fishing grounds which in turn brings the most money for the fish."

So for now, all the people out there who think they can always do it better on their own, think about this documentary.
