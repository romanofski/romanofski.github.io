<a href="http://www.holoweb.net/~liam/" target="_self">Liams</a> Idea made it into <a href="http://www.gimp.org" target="_self">GIMP</a>: the tips dialog now provides a link to more information in the user manual which covers the topic displayed as a tip.

I liked the idea providing a button which links to the manual and started hacking. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/romanofski/2705643131/" target="_self">My first attempt used a third button</a> in the dialog. <a href="http://www.mmiworks.net/eng/publications/blog.html" target="_self">Peter Sikking</a> disagreed with a third button. The buttons become to prominent in the dialog and a link should be displayed. <a href="http://svenfoo.geekheim.de/" target="_self">Sven</a> helped in providing useful development information. This feature will be available in the next stable release of GIMP (2.6).
