I wasted a bit of my free time to play <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.T.A.L.K.E.R.:_Shadow_of_Chernobyl" target="_self">S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</a> I was fighting myself through hordes of bandits, mercenaries, soldiers, monsters until I reached the sarcophagus totally wasted (small amount of ammunition and armor). The ending I picked, was to sneak into the sarcophagus of the collapsed power plant of Chernobyl and find the wish granter; a mysterious monolith granting you one free wish.

I found it. The ending is a video and the charactarer you're playing wishes.... <strong>"I want to be rich!"</strong>. The ending video shows him, rich of screws falling from the sarcophagus hull for a couple of seconds until he dies.

What a stupid moron? Such a stupid wish for all this work fighting through all the masses of evil? BRRRRRRR...

<strong>Update: </strong>I actually found a <a href="http://uk.guides.ign.com/guides/480467/page_16.html" target="_self">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. guide</a> which lists all the possible endings of the game. So, it's not <strong>the ending</strong> of the wish granter, but there are more endings determined by how you play.
