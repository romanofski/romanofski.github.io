This is a short one.

In case you're running in an error on your Plone site which looks similar to this:
<pre>File "[...]/eggs/Products.ResourceRegistries-2.0.3-py2.6.egg/Products/ResourceRegistries/browser/scripts.py", line 27, in scripts

Check if some of your javascripts have inline rendering enabled and obviously disable it. This seems to be more like a work around rather than a fix. Haven't had time to investigate what was really going wrong there. Any additional pointers welcome!
