It's not me who's getting tired. It looks like my five fingers are starting to give up on me. I recently washed my five fingers again and spotted a hole in one of the toes.

I'm now using the five fingers almost for <strong>seven months, every single day</strong>. I'm mostly walking on hard surfaces with sand and here is one disadvantage for the five fingers: A shoe which doesn't last for a year isn't worth A$ 200. Although I can imagine, that it is quite difficult to find a material which is flexible enough to be used as a sole and can still cope with the everyday use.
