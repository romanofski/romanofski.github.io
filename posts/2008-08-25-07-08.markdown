According to the study, the future of Saxony-Anhalt is very dark in terms of it's population (actually, most of East Europe). The birth-rate will not provide enough children to stop the loss of young people, which are migrating to the west, in the future. A lot of well educated (young) people are leaving the state incl. women.  Even parts of Romania look into a better future.

I wouldn't believe it if I would read the study, but it backs up my own experience. I was born in <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dessau" target="_self">Dessau</a> and have to say, the city (and most of other cities in Saxony-Anhalt) experience a huge loss of people. The biggest problem according to demographics is the loss of <strong>young people</strong>.

I really hope, that this loss will turn into a growth on some point, which proves the study wrong.
