If one of your units is not running any more and you find this in your journal: 
<pre>

it might be because your command really exits immediately and you may want to run the command manually to verify if that's the case. Also check if you indeed have the unit configured with <pre>Restart: always</pre>.

I you're sure it really does not restart too quickly, you can reset the counter with:

<pre>
$ systemctl reset-failed unit
</pre>

Further information can be found in the man pages of: systemd.unit(5) and systemd.service(5)
