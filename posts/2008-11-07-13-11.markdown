I'm playing on <a href="http://www.hubdub.com" target="_self">hubdub.com</a> from time to time. It's a funny online game of a prediction stock market. People creating questions for upcoming events and you can bet how this event will proceed in real.

For example: Who will be the new American president? Obama or McCain? Now it comes to all the news who've been floating around. Who will make it. That pushes the chances between Obama and McCain to various percentages. Say, for example, you startÂ  at a 12% probability that Obama makes it, while everyone sets on McCain. The more likely Obama will win the race the more money you will make if you sell your stocks. If you wait until the end when the question is settled, you earn the most money.

But don't forget: It's all play money ;)
