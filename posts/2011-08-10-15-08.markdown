	<li>What would the client want to see? Step back for 15 minutes to think about it but not longer.</li>
	<li>Allow a huge gap between things you say and do.</li>
	<li>Avoid every good practice you can find. Standardization is business suicide.</li>
	<li>Apply the same concepts you are comfortable on to new technology with the hope to learn something new.</li>
