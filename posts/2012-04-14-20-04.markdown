title: "Feelings after becoming a father"

I would have never expected it, but after becoming a father I learned new feelings:
<ul>
	<li>Being worried about the health of your child, but loving it anyway no matter what.</li>
	<li>How it feels to be in the hamster wheel.</li>
	<li>Being worried if you can feed your family and keep them safe.</li>
</ul>
