I tried to setup my <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMIME">smime</a> configuration today to use it with my mailer. The command involved in it was smime_keys. This command had a little bug. A small workaround was posted on the <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=453845">debian bugs mailinglist</a>:
<pre>vsauer@zaphod: ~ &gt; ln -s . "~"
vsauer@zaphod: ~ &gt; l -tr "~"</pre>
The workaround just creates a link to your own home directory to fool the smime_keys program (What a stupid hack actually).

What happened now, was the fact, that I stopped fixing the not working smime_keys program, because I had other things todo. I removed the link I created by using the workaround above:
<pre>rm -rf ~</pre>
Everyone who know how to interprete this command can laugh now ;) Fortunately I was lucky - phew.
