<a href="http://www.gocept.com">gocept</a> managed to provide two teams for a team triathlon in the southern part of Sachsony Anhalt, named <a href="http://www.braunsbetria.de">Rossbach an der Hasse</a>.Â  Our teams made it on the 97th and 100th place (of 129 starters). The triathlon was fun to do. The first placements were divided by the professionals. A big part of the whole time was determined by the bikes and most professionals with their hyper-carbon-super-airy-expensive-like-ass sport bikes.

I'm very satisfied with my standings (swam 13.15min for 750m, placed 37th). <a href="http://www.sw83.de/2008/07/volle-hasse.html">Sebastian Wehrman</a>, one of my team collegues did a 26mins run. Well done!

I'm actually looking for another event like this. Though I'd like to cut out the bike part. I don't own a sport bike and don't want to throw a huge amount at the materials. Maybe an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquathlon">Aquatlon</a> will be the next thing to do.
