If you need to quickly change a website, you can use a combination of CSS/XPath selectors and a function to hide/remove DOM nodes. I had to find my way through a long list of similar items which was really hard to go through by simply looking at it.

For example, you can simply delete all links you're not interested in by a simple combination of selector and function:
<pre>$x('//li/a[contains(., "not-interesting")]').map(function(n) { n.parentNode.removeChild(n) })</pre>
If you've made a mistake, reload the website.
