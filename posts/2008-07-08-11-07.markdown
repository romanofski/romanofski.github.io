It was a long time in the train yesterday and I started to hack on the help browser dialog. I never thought that it can be so much fun. I even got to some point and added type ahead search. Not a big deal for an experienced C programmer, but a feeling of success for myself. I want to finish that feature (needs some work), though a global search feature would be more helpful for the user :) Well, maybe that's the next thing?
